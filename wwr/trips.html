            <h3>7 Ways White Water Rafting in Gatlinburg Makes You Smarter</h3>
            <p>
                We all know that white water rafting in the Great Smoky Mountains is an excellent way to exercise and have fun. But did you know that it can make you smarter too? Read on for seven ways that white water rafting in Gatlinburg can increase your intelligence.
            </p>
            <h4>
                1. Aerobic Exercise is Good For Your Brain
            </h4>
            <p>
                Rowing a raft is a a great form of aerobic exercise that gives you a good cardio workout. Research shows that this type of exercise is good for your brain. Aerobic workouts provide your whole body, including your brain, with extra oxygen. While you can get this effect from jogging or working out on a treadmill at the gym, it’s a lot more fun to go white water rafting in the Great Smoky Mountains!
            </p>
            <h4>
                2. Mood and Memory Enhancer
            </h4>

            <p>
                The well-known “runner’s high” effect comes into play when you exercise. This involves the release of endorphins and serotonin in the brain, which elevates your mood. It also improves certain brain functions, such as memory. Exercise is a natural way to lift your spirits without the use of drugs or stimulants. White water rafting in one of the most scenic regions in the nation is especially conducive to enhancing your mood and mental functions.

            <h4>
                3. Increases Social Intelligence
            </h4>
            <p>
                When you work with people in a team setting, whether at work or in sports, you have to plan and strategize as a group. This works on certain parts of your brain that are essential for daily life. White water rafting is a group activity where you must cooperate with your team members every step of the way.
            </p>
            <h4>
                4. Improves Concentration
            </h4>

            <p>
                The world around us is full of distractions. If like many people, you spend hours in front of your computer, cell phone, and television, you may find it challenging to focus on one task at a time. White water rafting is an extremely focused athletic activity that compels you to give all of your attention to the present moment. This practice will help enhance your mental focus in your everyday life.
            </p>
            <h4>
                5. Helps You Develop Navigational Skills
            </h4>
            <p>
                A certain part of your brain is needed to help you navigate, whether you are walking, driving or white water rafting. Nowadays, technology reduces the need to use this part of our brain, as we rely on things like GPS. When you are rafting, however, you must engage this part of the brain as there are no road signs or devices on which you can depend.
            </p>
            <h4>
                6. Makes You More Active and Productive
            </h4>

            <p>
                One of the problems with modern society is that people are too sedentary. Being active physically is not only good for your body, but it’s also good for your mind. White water rafting in Gatlinburg is a form of exercise that makes you use many parts of your body. This gets you into an “action mode” that you can take back with you even after your rafting adventure is over.
            </p>
            <h4>
                7. Working Your Muscles Improves Cognitive Functions
            </h4>

            <p>
                White water rafting is not only an aerobic activity, it’s also a strength-building exercise that uses your muscles. Certain research suggests that strength training enhances brain function even more than aerobic exercise. Both, of course, are beneficial, and white water rafting gives you a whole body workout that involves both aerobics and strength training.
