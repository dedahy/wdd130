            <h3>A Vigorous Form of Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                Everyone knows about the benefits of exercise, but people often find it hard to get enough physical activity in their daily lives. White water rafting is a healthy alternative to a sedentary vacation spent in your car or in a lounge chair. Rafting works many muscle groups and provides a cardiovascular workout as well. The more difficult the rafting trip, the more calories you will burn. No matter what type of adventure you choose, however, you can be assured of getting some good exercise.
